I've found that a nice way to learn a new language is by working through Jamis
Buck's *Mazes for Programmers* using the language I'm trying to learn in place
of Ruby, the language used in the book.  Here, I'm doing just that with Kotlin.

This is my first-ever Kotlin code.  Don't take it as a good example of Kotlin
style or even as very good code at all.  While I'm getting my feet under me,
I'm following Buck's design choices even when they are at odds with Kotlin.  A
good example of this is that, at least initially, I'm sticking with Buck's
liberal use of `null` as a sentinel value, even when that makes life difficult
in Kotlin.  Once I'm familiar with expressing the basic algorithms in Kotlin,
I'll revisit those design choices and try to make the implementation more
Kotlinesque.
